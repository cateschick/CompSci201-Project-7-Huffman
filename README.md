# CompSci201 Project 7: Huffman

<h2>Introduction</h2>
This project was done as a part of CompSci201: Data Structures and Algorithms at Duke University. 

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<h3>Taken from the project description:</h3>

<p>Welcome to Huffman coding, your final programming assignment of the semester. Your task for this programming assignment will be to implement a fully functional Huffman coding suite equipped with methods to both compress and decompress files. Additionally for extra credit, you may opt to additionally implement the Burrows-Wheeler/Move-To-Front transformations which substantially increases the effectiveness of the Huffman Algorithm. This assignment specification/guide should be sufficient to walk you through both Huffman coding and Burrows-Wheeler step-by-step. However, if you run into any difficulties or are having trouble understanding exactly how Huffman coding works, then feel free to check out the Wikipedia article on Huffman coding, or, as always, the teaching staff will be available both at helper hours and on Piazza to assist you as well.</p>
